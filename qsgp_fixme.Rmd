##QSGP Example plots
QSGP is the most awesome class and I have learned so much! Below I show off on all the things I have learned!

```{r setup, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

First, let's do some joining on the flights data

```{r make the objects}

flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2

```
